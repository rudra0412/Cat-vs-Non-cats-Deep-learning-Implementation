# Cat-vs-Non-cat-Deep-learning-implementation

In this core implementation for Deep Learning invloved for Images/Image Processing Problems has been done.
I followed <b>Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai</b> Course for this.

In this first ipynb file named <b>"Building your Deep Neural Network - Step by Step"</b> contains all the function needed for basic ANN such as forward_activation_function, backward_functions etc.

So, that these implemented functions can be used for Cat vs Non-Cat application which is implemented in <b>"Deep Neural Network - Cat vs Non-Cat"</b>

## Data
Datasets has been loaded using h5 file for cats and non cats.
